Hi!

You've receied this email because you requested a password reset for FeedMe. If you did not request a password reset be careful! Something nefarious might be going on...

Click the link below to go to your profile edit page, where you can change your password.

<%= reset_api_user_url(@user) + "?reset_token=#{@user.reset_token}" %>

It'll only work once! Then you'll need to make another reset request!

Best,

The FeedMe team
